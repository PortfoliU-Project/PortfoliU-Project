# Markdown

Markdown was designed to be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions (like HTML). It is a markup language commonly used for writing simply formatted documents without needing to use a GUI to format text, such as using **bold** and *italics*. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format.

Documentation on programming projects is often lacking. Markdown is an important language for developers to master because it provides a 
means to discuss a project and features using a language that all web 
browsers and integrated development environments (IDEs) can understand, and its use across applications (GitHub, Slack, Notion, etc.).. Far 
easier than hypertext markup language (HTML) to learn, basic Markdown can be 
learned in a few minutes.
